The game is built on a straightforward turn-based system with the following rules:

- **Turn-Based System:** Players take turns rolling the die.
- **Reset on Roll of 1:** If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.
- **Hold Scores:** Clicking the "Hold" button adds the current player's current score to their total score.
- **Winning Condition:** The game ends when a player reaches a total score of 100.
- **Start a New Game:** Clicking "New Game" resets the game to its initial state.

These simple rules create an engaging and competitive experience, making it easy for players to understand and enjoy the game.
